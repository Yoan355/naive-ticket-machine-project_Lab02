Q2: The Value is $0 after it has printed out the ticket because there is no remaining money in the machine.

Q3: The machines minimum amount to print out a ticket is 350 cents,when I insert 1400 cents,
the machine allows me to print out 4 different tickets( 4 x 350 = 1400),meaning,
I still have a balance available.
Also, if you insert over the minimal amount,you receive a refund of the difference of the substraction of
the amount you inserted by the minimal amount (example: $351-$350 = 1$ refunded).
If i don't insert enough and try to print a ticket, it tells me that I can't print a ticket unless I insert
more money by telling me the minimum amount I have left to deposit.

Q5:No, the newly printed ticket from the newly made machine does not print out a different ticket
than the original, except for the minimal amount of money that I have to insert, which I customized.
